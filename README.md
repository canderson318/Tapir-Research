## Tapir covariate analyses

Analysis of *Tapirus* occupancy and activity. 
I used the overlap (version 0.3.4, https://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/personal/msr/overlap.html) package to plot the temporal density plots and the unmarked package (version 1.2.5, https://rbchan.github.io/unmarked/) to run occpancy models for occupancy probabilities and goodness of fit tests.
