#Malayan Tapir Temporal activity data
The Malayan Tapir's data had multiple records for one detection. The data (TapirDataMalaysia_2009-2011.csv) was cleaned by removing records that occured within one hour of 
each other at a specific location. The script is malayanDataCleanForIndRecords.R and resulted in TapirDataMalaysia_2009-2011_(independent_records_at_1hr).csv.
